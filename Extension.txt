OOP
If you didn’t use OOP as much as possible (at least in the client side) 
- do so! There are at least two separate concerns here: fetching data from your server, 
and rendering it.

More Data (non-trivial)
The resource we used for images also has some references for getting player stats.
Figure out how that works, and add another route in your server called /playerStats/:player.
When you click on any player’s image, it should display the player’s stats over the image.
